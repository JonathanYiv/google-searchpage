# Google Searchpage Project

This purpose of this project was to deconstruct and rebuild a webpage as accurately as possible.
The provided webpage was the [google searchpage](https://www.google.com/search?q=build+this+webpage) with the search "build this webpage."
This was the advanced version of a similar project, [build the google homepage](https://github.com/JonathanYiv/google-homepage).

This is a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css).

## Pre-Project Thoughts

Take note at this point I only have basic HTML, CSS, Chrome Dev Tool, and Git skills.
I will do my best!

## Post-Project Thoughts

It turned out pretty OK!
One thing the page is definitely missing is responsive design.
I will learn that later on in the curriculum.
